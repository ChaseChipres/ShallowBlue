# Introduction

Our project is using reinforcement learning to effectively gather resources underwater. Using Minecraft Malmo as our testbed, we dynamically create underwater environments with various resources scattered at the bed of the water. Our AI agent swims under water, finds resources, and swims up for air. As we work on this project, our goal is to better our agentâ€™s ability to find resources, stay alive, and navigate new underwater terrain!
