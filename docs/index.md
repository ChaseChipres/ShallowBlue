## What is intelligence?

### Introduction
The name for our project, ***Shallow Blue***, is a play off of ***Deep Blue***, the name of the famous IBM chess-playing computer that defeated Garry Kasparov.

### Project Summary
Our project uses reinforcement learning to effectively gather resources underwater. Using Minecraft Malmo as our testbed, we dynamically create underwater environments with various resources scattered at the bed of the water. Our AI agent swims under water, finds resources, and swims up for air. Our goal for this project is to improve our agent's ability to find resources, stay alive, and navigate new underwater terrain!
