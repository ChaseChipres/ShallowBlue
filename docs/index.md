## What is intelligence?

### Introduction
The name for our project, ***Shallow Blue***, comes from the famous IBM chess-playing computer ***Deep Blue***.

### Project Summary
Our project is using reinforcement learning to effectively gather resources underwater. Using Minecraft Malmo as our testbed, we dynamically create underwater environments with various resources scattered at the bed of the water. Our AI agent swims under water, finds resources, and swims up for air. As we work on this project, our goal is to better our agent's ability to find resources, stay alive, and navigate new underwater terrain!
